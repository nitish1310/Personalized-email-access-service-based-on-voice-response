# Personalized Email Access Service Based On Voice Response
This reposity contains the code for Personalized email access service based on voice response.

## Introduction:

The system integrates Google's text-to-speech API, and Machine Learning to create the personalized email access service based on voice response. The platform is based on express JS, React JS, React Native, machine learning technology, Google Vision API, Google Dialogflow and Google Cloud text-to-speech API. Developing React Native app (Android & iOS) and web platform of the application.

Google Cloud Text-to-Speech converts text into human-like speech in more than 180 voices across 30+ languages and variants. It applies groundbreaking research in speech synthesis (WaveNet) and Google's powerful neural networks to deliver high-fidelity audio. With this easy-to-use API, you can create lifelike interactions with your users that transform customer service, device interaction, and other applications.

The Actions on Google integration in Dialogflow allows interoperability between the Google Assistant and Dialogflow, letting you use Dialogflow agents as conversational fulfillment for your Actions. It give users new ways to interact with your product by building engaging voice and text-based conversational interfaces, such as voice apps and chatbots, powered by AI. Connect with users on your website, mobile app, the Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, and other popular platforms and devices.

Google Cloud’s Vision API offers powerful pre-trained machine learning models through REST and RPC APIs. Assign labels to images and quickly classify them into millions of predefined categories. Detect objects and faces, read printed and handwritten text, and build valuable metadata into your image catalog. Google Vision can detect whether you’re a cat or a human, as well as the parts of your face. It tries to detect whether you’re posed or doing something that wouldn’t be okay for Google Safe Search—or not. It even tries to detect if you’re happy or sad.
